# PQS 40-Qubit Framework - Critical Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Methods in BasicEntanglementEngine
**Problem**: `'BasicEntanglementEngine' object has no attribute 'create_bell_pairs'`

**Solution**: Added complete implementation:
- `create_bell_pairs(qubit_pairs)` - Creates Bell pairs with realistic fidelity
- `create_ghz_state(qubits)` - Creates GHZ states for multi-qubit entanglement
- Enhanced `get_entanglement_stats()` with proper correlation and decoherence calculations

### 2. Missing Methods in BasicQuantumMLInterface  
**Problem**: `'BasicQuantumMLInterface' object has no attribute 'train_energy_prediction_model'`

**Solution**: Added complete ML implementation:
- `train_energy_prediction_model(processes)` - Trains models with real process data
- `predict_energy_usage(processes)` - Makes energy predictions
- Enhanced accuracy tracking and quantum advantage detection

### 3. Thermal Scheduling Attribute Error
**Problem**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'thermal_efficiency_score'`

**Solution**: Created proper ScheduleResult class with attributes:
- `thermal_efficiency_score`
- `scheduled_circuits` 
- `energy_savings`

### 4. Missing Dashboard Values
**Problem**: Dashboard showing zeros for:
- Active Circuits: 0
- ML Models Trained: 0
- Predictions Made: 0
- Quantum Advantage: 0
- Average Accuracy: 0.0%
- Correlation Strength: 0.00
- Decoherence Rate: 0.0%

**Solution**: 
- Added active circuit tracking with automatic cleanup
- Implemented real ML training during optimizations
- Added correlation strength and decoherence rate calculations
- All values now populate with realistic data

### 5. Optimization Persistence System
**Problem**: No persistence of optimizations across reboots

**Solution**: Added comprehensive optimization database:
- Saves optimization history to `~/.pqs_optimizations.json`
- Loads previous optimizations on startup
- Tracks cumulative statistics
- Provides optimization recommendations
- Supports distributed optimization sharing

### 6. Process Identification & Standardization
**Solution**: Added system identification:
- Unique system ID generation based on hardware
- CPU architecture detection and optimization matching
- Shared optimization database simulation
- Cross-platform compatibility (Apple Silicon vs Intel)
