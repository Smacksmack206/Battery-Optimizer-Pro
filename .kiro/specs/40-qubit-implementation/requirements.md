## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**

### **NEVER MAKE UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES**

**RULE 1: NO CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
- ❌ **NEVER** disable features without explicit user request
- ❌ **NEVER** change timing intervals without explicit user request  
- ❌ **NEVER** modify auto-optimization settings without explicit user request
- ❌ **NEVER** change default configurations without explicit user request
- ❌ **NEVER** assume what the user wants - ASK FIRST

**RULE 2: PRESERVE USER INTENT**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** maintain original functionality unless specifically asked to change it
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask before making any behavioral changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS** explain what you're changing and why before making changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS** revert unauthorized changes immediately when called out

**RULE 3: THREADING FIXES - CORRECT APPROACH**
When fixing threading issues:
- ✅ **DO**: Add proper null checks (`if quantum_system and hasattr(quantum_system, 'initialized')`)
- ✅ **DO**: Use direct `rumps.alert()` calls without threading wrappers
- ✅ **DO**: Move heavy operations to background threads while keeping UI responsive
- ❌ **DON'T**: Disable auto-optimization to "fix" threading
- ❌ **DON'T**: Change timer intervals to "fix" threading
- ❌ **DON'T**: Modify user-intended functionality

**RULE 4: PROPER THREADING FIX EXAMPLES**

**WRONG APPROACH** (What NOT to do):
```python
# ❌ NEVER disable features to fix threading
"auto_optimize": False  # This breaks user intent

# ❌ NEVER change intervals without permission  
rumps.Timer(auto_optimize, 600).start()  # User wanted 30 seconds

# ❌ NEVER remove functionality
# Commenting out or disabling working features
```

**CORRECT APPROACH** (What TO do):
```python
# ✅ Add proper null checks
if quantum_system and hasattr(quantum_system, 'initialized') and quantum_system.initialized:
    # Safe to access quantum_system.initialized

# ✅ Use direct rumps.alert calls
@rumps.clicked("Menu Item")
def menu_callback(self, _):
    try:
        # Quick non-blocking operation
        rumps.alert("Title", "Message")
    except Exception as e:
        rumps.alert("Error", f"Error: {e}")

# ✅ Background threads for heavy operations only
def heavy_operation_background():
    # Do heavy work here
    rumps.notification("Complete", "Operation finished", "")

threading.Thread(target=heavy_operation_background, daemon=True).start()
```

**RULE 5: WHEN THREADING ISSUES OCCUR**

1. **IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE**:
   - Look for `NoneType` errors → Add null checks
   - Look for blocking operations in menu callbacks → Move to background threads
   - Look for heavy operations in UI thread → Use background threads

2. **APPLY MINIMAL FIXES**:
   - Add null checks: `if obj and hasattr(obj, 'attr')`
   - Use direct `rumps.alert()` calls
   - Move only heavy operations to background threads

3. **PRESERVE ALL USER SETTINGS**:
   - Keep auto-optimization enabled if user wants it
   - Keep original timer intervals
   - Keep original functionality intact

**RULE 6: COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS**

Before making ANY changes:
1. **ASK**: "I need to fix the threading issue. I will add null checks and move heavy operations to background threads. Is this okay?"
2. **EXPLAIN**: "This will fix the freezing without changing your auto-optimization settings."
3. **CONFIRM**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**:
- Making unauthorized changes violates user trust
- Disabling features without permission breaks the system's intended functionality
- Changing settings without asking demonstrates poor development practices

1. **100% Authentic Real-Time Data** - Eliminate all estimates and mock values
